# benchmark using the hypervisor backend

# checklist before run:
# 1. small only or small+med
# 2. barrier
# 3. scheduling switches (time, intra, noise)
# 4. dynamic (qasm3-runner, this option is no longer available in the new IBM API)
# 5. access token
# 6. backend choice (brisbane, kyoto, etc.)
# 7. intra vm scheduling
# 8. calibration data output path
